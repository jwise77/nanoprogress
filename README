timestep

Usage: ./nanoProgress [enzo stdout]

No flags necessary.

nanoProgress parses through a file with enzo's STDOUT for the
timesteps on each AMR level.  It starts with the last topgrid
timestep.  After collecting all of these data, it tells the user (a)
the total code time elapsed on each level, (b) average timestep, (c)
number of timesteps, and (d) total number of timesteps required to
finish a topgrid timestep.  It also gives the redshift, code time,
topgrid dt, and cycle number of the last topgrid timestep.
